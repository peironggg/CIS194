Validating Credit Card Numbers1
Have you ever wondered how websites validate your credit card
number when you shop online? They don’t check a massive database
of numbers, and they don’t use magic. In fact, most credit providers
rely on a checksum formula for distinguishing valid numbers from
random collections of digits (or typing mistakes).
In this section, you will implement the validation algorithm for
credit cards. It follows these steps:

• Double the value of every second digit beginning from the right.
That is, the last digit is unchanged; the second-to-last digit is doubled; the third-to-last digit is unchanged; and so on. For example,
[1,3,8,6] becomes [2,3,16,6].

• Add the digits of the doubled values and the undoubled digits from the original number. For example, [2,3,16,6] becomes
2+3+1+6+6 = 18.

• Calculate the remainder when the sum is divided by 10. For the
above example, the remainder would be 8.
If the result equals 0, then the number is valid.

Exercise 1 We need to first find the digits of a number. Define the
functions
toDigits :: Integer -> [Integer]
toDigitsRev :: Integer -> [Integer]
toDigits should convert positive Integers to a list of digits. (For 0 or
negative inputs, toDigits should return the empty list.) toDigitsRev
should do the same, but with the digits reversed.
Example: toDigits 1234 == [1,2,3,4]
Example: toDigitsRev 1234 == [4,3,2,1]
Example: toDigits 0 == []
Example: toDigits (-17) == []
-}
-- Exercise 1
toDigits :: Integer -> [Integer]
toDigits n = (reverse . toDigitsRev) n

toDigitsRev :: Integer -> [Integer]
toDigitsRev n
  | n <= 0 = []
  | otherwise = (n `mod` 10) : toDigitsRev (n `div` 10)

{-
Exercise 2 Once we have the digits in the proper order, we need to
double every other one. Define a function
doubleEveryOther :: [Integer] -> [Integer]
Remember that doubleEveryOther should double every other number beginning from the right, that is, the second-to-last, fourth-to-last,
. . . numbers are doubled.
Example: doubleEveryOther [8,7,6,5] == [16,7,12,5]
Example: doubleEveryOther [1,2,3] == [1,4,3]
-}
-- Exercise 2
doubleEveryOther :: [Integer] -> [Integer]
doubleEveryOther xs = reverse $ zipWith (*) (cycle [1, 2]) (reverse xs)



{-
Exercise 3 The output of doubleEveryOther has a mix of one-digit
and two-digit numbers. Define the function
sumDigits :: [Integer] -> Integer
to calculate the sum of all digits.
Example: sumDigits [16,7,12,5] = 1 + 6 + 7 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 22
-}
-- Exercise 3
sumDigit :: Integer -> Integer
sumDigit n
  | n <= 9    = n
  | otherwise = (sumDigits . toDigits) n

sumDigits :: [Integer] -> Integer
sumDigits [] = 0
sumDigits (x : xs) = sumDigit x + sumDigits xs

{-
Exercise 4 Define the function
validate :: Integer -> Bool
that indicates whether an Integer could be a valid credit card number. This will use all functions defined in the previous exercises.
Example: validate 4012888888881881 = True
Example: validate 4012888888881882 = False
-}
-- Exercise 4
validate :: Integer -> Bool
validate n = ((0 ==) . (`mod` 10) . sumDigits . doubleEveryOther . toDigits)(n)

Exercise 5 The Towers of Hanoi is a classic puzzle with a solution
that can be described recursively. Disks of different sizes are stacked
on three pegs; the goal is to get from a starting configuration with
all disks stacked on the first peg to an ending configuration with all
disks stacked on the last peg, as shown in Figure 1.
⇓
Figure 1: The Towers of Hanoi
The only rules are
• you may only move one disk at a time, and
• a larger disk may never be stacked on top of a smaller one.
For example, as the first move all you can do is move the topmost,
smallest disk onto a different peg, since only one disk may be moved
at a time.
Figure 2: A valid first move. From this point, it is illegal to move to the configuration shown in
Figure 3, because you are not allowed to put the green disk on top of
the smaller blue one.
Figure 3: An illegal configuration.
To move n discs (stacked in increasing size) from peg a to peg b
using peg c as temporary storage,
1. move n − 1 discs from a to c using b as temporary storage
2. move the top disc from a to b
3. move n − 1 discs from c to b using a as temporary storage.
For this exercise, define a function hanoi with the following type:
type Peg = String
type Move = (Peg, Peg)
hanoi :: Integer -> Peg -> Peg -> Peg -> [Move]

Given the number of discs and names for the three pegs, hanoi
should return a list of moves to be performed to move the stack of
discs from the first peg to the second.
Note that a type declaration, like type Peg = String above, makes
a type synonym. In this case Peg is declared as a synonym for String,
and the two names Peg and String can now be used interchangeably.
Giving more descriptive names to types in this way can be used to
give shorter names to complicated types, or (as here) simply to help
with documentation.
Example: hanoi 2 "a" "b" "c" == [("a","c"), ("a","b"), ("c","b")]
-}
-- Exercise 5
type Peg = String
type Move = (Peg, Peg)

hanoi :: Integer -> Peg -> Peg -> Peg -> [Move]
hanoi 1 a b _ = [(a, b)]
hanoi n a b c = hanoi (n - 1) a c b ++ [(a, b)] ++ hanoi (n - 1) c b a


{-
Exercise 6 (Optional) What if there are four pegs instead of three?
That is, the goal is still to move a stack of discs from the first peg to
the last peg, without ever placing a larger disc on top of a smaller
one, but now there are two extra pegs that can be used as “temporary” storage instead of only one. Write a function similar to hanoi
which solves this problem in as few moves as possible.
It should be possible to do it in far fewer moves than with three
pegs. For example, with three pegs it takes 215 − 1 = 32767 moves
to transfer 15 discs. With four pegs it can be done in 129 moves.

-- Exercise 6
hanoiOp :: Integer -> Peg -> Peg -> Peg -> Peg -> [Move]
hanoiOp 1 a b _ _ = [(a, b)]
hanoiOp 2 a b c _ = [(a, c), (a, b), (c, b)]
hanoiOp 3 a b c d = [(a, c), (a, d), (a, b), (d, b), (c, b)]
hanoiOp n a b c d = hanoiOp (n - 1) a c b d ++ hanoiOp 1 a b c d ++ hanoiOp (n - 1) c b a d
